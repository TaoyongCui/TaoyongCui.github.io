Welcome to my personal web page! 

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the AI4LS Laboratory and [Multimedia Laboratory](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), co-supervised by [Prof. Pheng Ann Heng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=OFdytjoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Prof. Wanli Ouyang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=pw_0Z_UAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Before joining CUHK, I received my Academic Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Tsinghua University.

I served as a research intern at Microsoft Research and Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and have served as a reviewer for AISTATS, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, and AAAI.

My research interests are in AI for science â€” in particular, machine learning force field, deep generative models, and LLM applications. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.
